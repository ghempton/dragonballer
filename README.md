## Branching

This repository seeks to provide some interesting branching activity in its
history. This section details some of the branching structures that are
provided by this repository.

- a simple feature branch with no intermittent activity on the master branch:

  - between 35c67eb68f1a8ba5d9829617769fed5f190669ec and
    387c2d30b99a573b1dd45140f3da8f00a6c7f90a

- a simple feature branch with some intermittent activity on the master
  branch:

  - between d8d5bf4dba7615405351f3eade39de777faf39a1 and
    1f701d419d949b6d55749962207404745a30763e
  - between 5e173093e893542c02459c253dd4058dd4d03ced and

    e8240e6a0c144bfa4b9f246263ccef1fbd57b177

- a feature branch that temporarily branched from itself to make a
  fix with other intermittent changes to master branch:

  - between 02e41880fff00fdc7631d3a372aeb966b5cb00ce and
    08c1ef9cd3eb22094365f769e5ffb0a297677ac9

- two different feature branches off of the master branch that first merged
  together before merging back into the master branch with intermittent
  changes across all of them:

  - between fc9717a8d652cd0dc40173494ce95787a028c840 and
    ade25d2b59e81dae08044a6d27fcf3b63019164e (minimal)
  - between 4dec1250914260e82d3cfd41c28d434adfc05567 and
    ade25d2b59e81dae08044a6d27fcf3b63019164e (non-minimal)

- a feature branch that merges commits from the master branch into itself
  before later being merged back into the master branch:
